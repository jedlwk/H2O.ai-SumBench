## Stage 1: Integrity Check (Source vs Summary)

These metrics always run — they only need the source document and the generated summary.

---

### 1.1 Faithfulness

**Question:** Does the summary stick to the source without hallucinating?

These metrics detect made-up facts, contradictions, and claims that can't be traced back to the source.

---

#### NLI - Natural Language Inference
**Model:** `microsoft/deberta-v3-base` (~440MB)

**What it does:** Uses natural language inference to check if the source text *logically supports* the summary.

**How it works:**
```
Source: "Apple released iPhone 15 in September 2023"
Summary: "Apple launched a new iPhone last fall"
→ Result: ENTAILMENT (0.85) - Source supports the claim
```

**Scores:**
- 0.7-1.0: Highly consistent (source supports summary)
- 0.4-0.7: Neutral (neither proven nor disproven)
- 0.0-0.4: Inconsistent (potential contradictions)

**Limitation:** Truncates text to 400 words. Long documents may lose context.

---

#### FactCC - Factual Consistency Checker
**Model:** `microsoft/deberta-base-mnli` (~440MB)

**What it does:** Binary classification - is the summary consistent with the source?

**How it works:** Fine-tuned on synthetic errors (swapped dates, names, numbers) to detect factual inconsistencies.

**Scores:**
- 0.6-1.0: Consistent
- 0.0-0.6: Inconsistent (flags potential issues)

**Note:** This implementation uses DeBERTa-MNLI as the original FactCC checkpoint has compatibility issues.

---

#### AlignScore - Unified Alignment Metric
**Model:** `liuyanyi/AlignScore-large-hf` (~1.4GB, RoBERTa-large based)

**What it does:** State-of-the-art factual consistency metric trained on 7 diverse alignment tasks.

**Why it's good:** Combines insights from NLI, QA, and paraphrasing tasks into one score.

**Scores:**
- 0.7-1.0: Highly consistent
- 0.5-0.7: Mostly consistent
- 0.3-0.5: Partially consistent
- 0.0-0.3: Inconsistent

**Paper:** "AlignScore: Evaluating Factual Consistency with a Unified Alignment Function" (ACL 2023)

---

#### Coverage Score (Named Entity Overlap)
**Model:** `spaCy/en_core_web_sm` (~12MB)

**What it does:** Checks if named entities (people, places, organizations, dates) from the source appear in the summary.

**Example:**
```
Source entities: ["Apple", "Tim Cook", "September 2023", "iPhone 15"]
Summary entities: ["Apple", "iPhone 15"]
→ Coverage: 50% (2/4 entities)
```

**Why it matters:** If key entities are missing, the summary likely missed important information.

**Scores:**
- 0.7-1.0: Excellent coverage
- 0.5-0.7: Good coverage
- 0.3-0.5: Partial coverage
- 0.0-0.3: Poor coverage

---

### 1.2 Completeness

**Question:** How much of the essential source meaning was captured?

These metrics check if key information and main points from the source are preserved in the summary.

---

#### Semantic Coverage
**Model:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (~80MB, sentence-transformers)

**What it does:** Counts how many source sentences are semantically represented in the summary.

**How it works:**
1. Split source into sentences
2. For each source sentence, find most similar summary sentence
3. If similarity > 0.7, mark as "covered"
4. Score = covered sentences / total sentences

**Example:**
```
Source: 10 sentences
Covered: 3 sentences (similarity > 0.7)
→ Score: 0.30 (30% coverage)
```

**Interpretation:** Low coverage doesn't mean bad - a concise summary naturally covers less. Check this alongside quality metrics.

---

#### BERTScore Recall (vs Source)
**Model:** `roberta-large` (~1.4GB)

**What it does:** Measures what fraction of the source's *meaning* is captured in the summary.

**Why "Recall"?**
- Precision = "How much of the summary is relevant?"
- **Recall** = "How much of the source did we capture?"

For completeness checking, recall is what matters.

**Scores:** (after baseline rescaling)
- 0.6-1.0: Good recall
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate recall
- 0.0-0.4: Low recall (missing content)

---

### 1.3 Holistic Assessment

**Question:** How does the summary perform across multiple quality dimensions?

These API-based metrics use a large language model to evaluate quality like a human expert.

---

#### DAG - Decision Tree Evaluation
**Model:** API-based

**What it does:** Evaluates summaries using a 3-step decision tree:

```
Step 1: Is it FACTUAL? (0-2 points)
   └─ "Does the summary only state facts from the source?"

Step 2: Is it COMPLETE? (0-2 points)
   └─ "Are the main points included?"

Step 3: Is it CLEAR? (0-2 points)
   └─ "Is it easy to understand?"

Total: 0-6 points
```

**Example Scoring:**
- 6/6: Perfect - accurate, complete, and clear
- 4/6: Good but missing something
- 2/6: Major issues to address

---

#### Prometheus
**Model:** API-based

**What it does:** Open-source LLM judge that grades summaries on a 1-5 scale.

**Scale:**
- 5: Excellent
- 4: Good
- 3: Acceptable
- 2: Poor
- 1: Very Poor

**Paper:** "Prometheus: Inducing Fine-Grained Evaluation Capability in Language Models" (2023)

---

#### G-Eval Faithfulness
**Model:** API-based (default: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)

**What it does:** Uses a large language model to evaluate factual accuracy like a human expert.

**Question Asked:** "Can every claim in the summary be traced back to the source?"

**Scores (1-10):**
- 9-10: Excellent - all claims supported
- 7-8: Good - minor unsupported details
- 5-6: Acceptable - some claims unverifiable
- 1-4: Poor - significant hallucinations

---

#### G-Eval Relevance
**Model:** API-based (default: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)

**What it does:** Uses a large language model to evaluate information coverage.

**Question Asked:** "Are the important points from the source included?"

**Scores (1-10):**
- 9-10: Excellent - all main points included
- 7-8: Good - most important points covered
- 5-6: Acceptable - key points present but gaps
- 1-4: Poor - major information missing

---

#### G-Eval Coherence
**Model:** API-based (default: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)

**Question Asked:** "Does the summary flow logically from start to finish?"

**Scores (1-10):**
- 9-10: Excellent - clear logical structure
- 7-8: Good - mostly coherent
- 5-6: Acceptable - some disjointed sections
- 1-4: Poor - confusing or illogical

---

#### G-Eval Fluency
**Model:** API-based (default: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`)

**Question Asked:** "Is the summary grammatically correct and natural?"

**Scores (1-10):**
- 9-10: Excellent - publication-ready
- 7-8: Good - minor issues
- 5-6: Acceptable - noticeable errors
- 1-4: Poor - significant grammar/style problems

---

## Stage 2: Conformance Check (Generated vs Reference)

These metrics require a reference summary for comparison. They measure how closely the generated summary matches a "gold standard" reference.

---

### 2.1 Semantic Similarity

**Question:** How well does the summary match the reference in meaning?

These metrics measure whether your summary captures the same meaning as the reference, even if using different words.

---

#### BERTScore (vs Reference)
**Model:** `roberta-large` (~1.4GB)

**What it does:** Computes semantic similarity using contextual embeddings.

**Three Scores:**
- **Precision:** "How much of my summary is relevant to the reference?"
- **Recall:** "How much of the reference did my summary capture?"
- **F1:** Balanced average (your main number)

**Why it's good:** Understands synonyms and paraphrasing.
```
"The CEO resigned" ≈ "The company's leader stepped down"
→ High BERTScore despite different words
```

---

#### MoverScore
**Model:** `distilbert-base-uncased` (~260MB)

**What it does:** Measures the "effort" to transform one meaning into another using Earth Mover's Distance.

**Intuition:** Imagine moving piles of sand - how much work to rearrange the summary's meaning to match the reference?

**Limitation:** 400-word limit per text.

---

### 2.2 Lexical Similarity

**Question:** How many specific words/phrases match the reference?

These metrics count exact lexical matches - same words, same phrases, same structure.

---

#### ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L
**Model:** None (rule-based)

**What they measure:**

| Metric | What It Counts | Good For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **ROUGE-1** | Single word overlap | Basic vocabulary check |
| **ROUGE-2** | Two-word phrase overlap | Phrase-level matching |
| **ROUGE-L** | Longest matching sequence | Structure and word order |

**Example:**
```
Reference: "The quick brown fox jumps"
Summary: "A quick brown fox leaps"

ROUGE-1: 4/5 words match (quick, brown, fox, the→a)
ROUGE-2: 2/4 bigrams match (quick brown, brown fox)
ROUGE-L: "quick brown fox" = 3 words in sequence
```

---

#### BLEU
**Model:** None (rule-based)

**What it does:** Precision-focused n-gram matching, originally for machine translation.

**Caution:** BLEU penalizes short outputs heavily. Scores tend to be lower for summaries.
- 0.3+ is good for summarization
- Don't compare BLEU across different tasks

---

#### METEOR
**Model:** WordNet (~100MB via NLTK)

**What it does:** Word matching that allows:
- Stemming: "running" = "run"
- Synonyms: "fast" = "quick"

**Why it's useful:** More forgiving than pure word matching.

---

#### chrF++
**Model:** None (rule-based)

**What it does:** Character-level F-score. Matches at the character level rather than word level.

**Why it's useful:**
- Handles typos better
- Works well for morphologically rich languages
- Robust to tokenization differences

---

#### Levenshtein Similarity
**Model:** None (rule-based)

**What it does:** Edit distance - how many character changes to transform summary into reference?

**Score:** Normalized to 0-1 (1 = identical, 0 = completely different)

---

#### Perplexity
**Model:** `GPT-2` (~600MB)

**What it does:** Measures how "surprised" a language model is by the text. Lower perplexity = more natural.

**Score:** Normalized using `1 / (1 + log(perplexity))`
- Higher = more fluent
- Lower = awkward phrasing

---

## LLM-as-a-Judge (Custom)

**Question:** Does the summary meet your own domain-specific criteria?

This feature lets you write a custom prompt template and have the LLM score the summary on a 1-10 scale.

---

### Custom Judge
**Model:** API-based (uses the selected LLM model)

**What it does:** Substitutes your text into a prompt template and asks the LLM to score 1-10 with an explanation.

**Placeholders:**
- `{PROMPT}` — replaced with the source document
- `{PREDICTED_TEXT}` — replaced with the generated summary
- `{TARGET_TEXT}` — replaced with the reference summary (if provided)

**Default template:** A general-purpose judge prompt evaluating helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, and creativity. You can edit or replace it entirely.

**Batch support:** When criteria are set, batch evaluation automatically adds `custom_judge_score` and `custom_judge_explanation` columns.

**Scores (1-10):**
- 8-10: Strong performance on your criteria
- 5-7: Mixed results — review explanation
- 1-4: Significant gaps identified
