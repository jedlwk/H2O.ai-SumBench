The board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, payable November 15, 2024.

    "source": "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously on September 18, 2024, to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a target range of 4.75% to 5.00%. This marked the first rate cut since March 2020 and followed 11 consecutive rate increases that began in March 2022. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the post-meeting press conference that the decision reflected the Committee's 'growing confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.' The September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC participant expects the federal funds rate to end 2024 at 4.25-4.50%, implying an additional 50 basis points of cuts by year-end. The projections also showed core PCE inflation expected to decline to 2.6% by year-end 2024 and 2.2% by end of 2025. The unemployment rate projection was revised upward to 4.4% for Q4 2024, from 4.0% in the June projections. Powell emphasized that 'the labor market is in solid condition' but acknowledged that 'the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.' The Committee's statement noted that 'job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.' The 10-year Treasury yield fell 12 basis points to 3.62% following the announcement, while the S&P 500 initially rallied 1.2% before closing roughly flat.",

Chair Powell expressed confidence that inflation is moving toward the 2% target. The central bank's projections suggest more cuts are likely by year-end. The labor market remains solid despite some cooling, with unemployment projected at 4.4%. Markets responded positively to the announcement with Treasury yields declining."

The company seeks to raise approximately $500 million at an expected price range of $22 to $26 per share. NovaBio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing next-generation mRNA therapeutics for rare genetic disorders. The company's lead candidate, NVB-401, is currently in Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of Fabry disease, with topline results expected in Q1 2025. In its pivotal Phase 2a trial, NVB-401 demonstrated a 62% reduction in plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels compared to 31% for the current standard of care. Revenue for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, was $12.3 million, consisting entirely of collaboration revenue from a partnership with Roche Pharmaceuticals. The company reported a net loss of $187 million for the same period, compared to $143 million in the prior year. As of September 30, 2024, NovaBio had cash and cash equivalents of $340 million, which the company estimates will fund operations through Q3 2025. Risk factors highlighted in the filing include: dependence on a single lead product candidate, the need for substantial additional capital, the uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes, potential regulatory delays, and competition from established gene therapy companies including BioMarin, Sarepta, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The company has 156 employees, with 112 in R&D. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are serving as lead underwriters.",

    "source": "An explosion at the Hartfield Chemical Processing plant in Port Arthur, Texas, on the morning of August 12, 2024, killed 4 workers and injured 23 others, 8 of whom were in critical condition. The blast occurred at approximately 6:47 AM local time in the facility's distillation unit, where operators were processing a batch of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a chemical used in polyurethane manufacturing. According to the preliminary investigation by the Chemical Safety Board (CSB), a temperature sensor in reactor vessel R-204 malfunctioned, failing to detect a runaway exothermic reaction. By the time operators noticed the temperature anomaly through secondary monitoring, the reactor pressure had exceeded its design limit of 150 psi, reaching an estimated 340 psi before the vessel ruptured. The resulting explosion created a fireball visible from 3 miles away and damaged an adjacent storage tank containing 50,000 gallons of methanol, which ignited approximately 12 minutes after the initial blast. Emergency responders from four surrounding counties were dispatched. Evacuation orders were issued for a 2-mile radius affecting approximately 4,200 residents. The fire was not fully contained until 18 hours later. OSHA records show that Hartfield had received three citations in the past five years for violations related to process safety management, including a willful violation in 2022 for failure to maintain safety instrumented systems. The company's most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2021. Environmental monitoring in the days following the incident detected elevated levels of hydrogen cyanide and phosgene in the surrounding area, both byproducts of TDI combustion. The EPA issued an emergency response order requiring Hartfield to conduct comprehensive air and soil testing within a 5-mile radius.",

A United Airlines Boeing 777-300ER (Flight UA 891, inbound from Tokyo Narita) on final approach to Runway 28L came within 380 feet vertically and approximately 0.3 nautical miles laterally of a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 (Flight WN 2247, departing on Runway 28R). The incident occurred when the SFO tower controller cleared WN 2247 for takeoff on 28R while UA 891 was on a 3-mile final for the parallel Runway 28L. During the takeoff roll, WN 2247 began drifting left of the 28R centerline due to a crosswind of 18 knots gusting to 27 knots from the northwest. The tower controller issued a corrective instruction to WN 2247 at 11:42:18, directing the crew to 'fly runway heading.' Simultaneously, the approach controller handling UA 891 issued a go-around instruction at 11:42:22 when the ASDE-X ground radar showed converging flight paths. The UA 891 crew executed the go-around, climbing through 1,200 feet as WN 2247 passed through 820 feet in its initial climb. ATC voice recordings show that the tower controller had coordinated the departure sequence with the TRACON approach controller, but the coordination assumed standard wind conditions and did not account for the gusty crosswind that caused the lateral deviation. There were 389 passengers and 16 crew aboard UA 891, and 176 passengers and 6 crew aboard WN 2247 — a total of 587 people. No injuries were reported. SFO temporarily suspended parallel runway operations for 45 minutes following the incident.

    "source": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued citations totaling $1.24 million against Pinnacle Construction Group following a workplace safety investigation triggered by the death of a worker at a high-rise construction site in downtown Chicago on July 8, 2024. The worker, 31-year-old Miguel Herrera, fell 18 stories (approximately 198 feet) when a temporary guardrail on the 22nd floor gave way. The investigation found that the guardrail had been improperly installed using standard wood screws instead of the specified structural bolts, and that it had not been inspected as required before the shift began. OSHA cited Pinnacle for 14 willful violations and 8 serious violations. The willful violations included: failure to ensure guardrails met minimum strength requirements (29 CFR 1926.502(b)(3)), failure to conduct required pre-shift safety inspections, failure to provide adequate fall protection training, and allowing workers on floors above the 15th level without secondary fall arrest systems. The serious violations included inadequate scaffolding bracing on three floors, blocked emergency exits, and failure to maintain safety data sheets for hazardous materials on site. OSHA Area Director Patricia Gomez stated, 'This tragedy was entirely preventable. Pinnacle Construction showed a willful disregard for the safety of its workers by cutting corners on fundamental fall protection measures.' Pinnacle had been cited twice previously by OSHA in the past three years — a $45,000 penalty in 2022 for scaffolding violations in Miami and a $78,000 penalty in 2023 for fall protection violations in Atlanta.

The storm brought a storm surge of 8 to 12 feet along the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast, the highest surge recorded in that area since Hurricane Idalia in 2023. Prior to landfall, Governor Ron DeSantis issued mandatory evacuation orders for Zone A in 12 coastal counties on October 6, affecting approximately 1.2 million residents. The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) pre-positioned 3,500 National Guard troops, 250 high-water rescue vehicles, and 18 helicopter rescue teams across the projected impact zone. Despite these preparations, the storm's rapid intensification from Category 1 to Category 3 in the 18 hours before landfall caught some residents off guard.
